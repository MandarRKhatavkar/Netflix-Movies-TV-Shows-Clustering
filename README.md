<h2>Introduction</h2>
Netflix, the world’s largest on-demand internet streaming media and online DVD movie rental service provider.it Founded August 29, 1997, in Los Gatos, California by Marc and Reed. It has 69 million members in over 60 countries enjoying more than 100 million hours of TV shows and movies per day Netflix is the world’s leading internet entertainment service with enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. I was curious to analyze the content released in Netflix platform which led me to create these simple, interactive, and exciting visualizations and find similar groups of people.
<h2> Problem Statement</h2>
The goal of this project is to find similarity within groups of people to build a movie recommendation system for users. We are going to analyze a dataset from the Netflix database to explore the characteristics that people share in movies. We have experienced it ourselves or have been in the room, the endless scrolling of selecting what to watch. Users spend more time deciding what to watch than watching their movie.
<h2>Algorithm Used</h2>
KMEANS-SILHOUTTE SCORE, ELBOW METHOD
